#  VBA of Wall Street
Multiple fast-track learning opportunities in a second week of traversing the programming capabilities of spreadsheets.

##   Overview of Project
Adding to prior skills obtained with charting and pivoting, now built-in coding ability of Excel is revealed in this module via a friend "Steve" -- recent financial program graduate -- who is aiding his parents to analyze stocks in their quest to diversify "green energy" investment interests.  In the process, data for a number of relevant stocks were reviewed for trading volumes and historical returns over a period of two years.

###  Purpose
Provide method to learn fundamental coding topics, including data types, loop and conditional structures, pseudo-code and refactoring.

##  Analysis
In a challenge to find a suitable recommendation to Steve for his parents, the review involved determining and presenting returns with tabular data prepared programmatically. After an analysis of the data, through a "refactoring" process the efficiency of the code itself was able to be improved. As revealed by timing tests, the speed with which the coding routines were able to calculate and prepare the results was greater by over five-fold.  The linked image files show that for 2017 and 2018 stock ticker data, the refactored "AllStocksAnalysis" subroutine consistently outpaced the non-refactored version. Included images of two test runs show  the refactored macro returning results in for both 2017 and 2018 data sets in 0.09375 seconds, compared to 0.59375 seconds non-refactored (screenshots attached). The unformatted version of the non-refactored routine, though faster was still comparatively slower by almost the same magnitude than the refactored one.

### Results
Coding Snippet Comparisons





## Summary
If processing speed is a significant concern, timing tests are consistent to prove that though the refactoring process may require more involved knowledge of data structures and computing power of machines, the timely throughput appears well worth the additional efforts to code.
